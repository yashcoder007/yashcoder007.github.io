## Description

In this project the XGBoost classifier is used to predict/identify the fraud credit card transactions. The model was trained on more than 1 million transactions and hyperparameter tuning was done to maximize the accuracy of the model. This model could be used in security environment and will be able to identify and prevent fraud transactions in the future.
