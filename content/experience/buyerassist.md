### Description

- Developed a deep learning framework using **YOLOV7** for fruit detection in large orchards which can be directly used for robotic harvesting eliminating a lot of manual labour.
- Integrated DeepSORT which is an object tracking algorithm with object detection framework for automating manual fruit counting. The model was trained on both daytime and nighttime images to make it more robust.  
- The proposed framework had an accuracy of 95% which runs at a speed of 24 FPS. 
- Performed extensive hyperparameter tuning and modified feature extraction method to increase the models efficiency by 5%.
- Deployed the whole framework on AWS cloud and used services like **sagemaker** for model training, **S3** bucket for storing the database and **lambda** function for scaling the entire application.
