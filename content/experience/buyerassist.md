## Description

### Project 1

- Developed a lightweight deep learning-based real-time fruit detection model using SOTA YOLO V7 for automatic robotic harvesting in dubai with high accuracy and low inference speed.
- Reduced the fruit detection speed to less than 24FPS by integrating Feature Pyramid Network(FPN) to YOLOv7.
- Added a feature of real-time live fruit counting by integrating an object tracking system DeepSort with modified
- YOLOv7 on large mango and apple orchard image data with the Mean Average Precision of 94%.
- Deployed the architecture on AWS cloud using SageMaker, EC2, lambda and S3 to make the pipeline scalable for the farmers of dubai.

### Project 2

- Extracted the data using SQL from different databases and performed ETL to make it usable for analysis. Created
data dashboards for analysis using Tableau.
- Identified patterns and trends in the data related to virus attacks. This could include identifying geographical hotspots, identifying risk factors, and detecting changes in the spread of the virus over time.
- Developed predictive models to forecast the spread of the virus and identified potential outbreaks before they occur.
- Used machine learning algorithms(Random Forest, SVM) and other advanced techniques to analyze the data and
make predictions.
- Developed and maintained reporting and visualization tools to present data and insights to stakeholders in the
company.
