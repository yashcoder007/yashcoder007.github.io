I was working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the lab where I was leading the research group  under the supervision of Dr. Luis Rueda [link](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2OPjLFkAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Finance
1. Built an unsupervised predictive model using K-means clustering and PCA for customer behaviour analysis and categorization to target customers with customized products, promotions and advertising, leading to a 10% increase in cross-sell revenue.
2. Developed a time series-based product sales forecasting machine learning model using LightGBM and ARIMA, resulting in a 15% reduction in inventory costs.
3. Designed an ensemble of LightGBM and feed-forward Neural Network to predict future customer orders with 85% accuracy, leading to customer-specific promotions and marketing.
4. Designed an automated fraud detection system using XGBoost with PCA and Hyperopt (hyperparameter tuning) for reducing fraudulent customer transactions with an accuracy of 90%

## Computer Vision 
1. Developed a novel unsupervised automatic lung tumour detection pipeline by stacking together data mining techniques like spectral and hierarchical clustering, region adjacency graph, and multilevel thresholding with an average accuracy of 99.8% and an average sensitivity of 95.15%.
2. Reduced the time taken for tumour detection in CT images of size 512 x 512 by applying the concept of superpixels in the above-mentioned framework. The framework works in O(n), taking only 6s to detect a tumour.
3. Implemented SVM, Random Forest and KNN with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for detecting cancer
cells and marker genes responsible for breast cancer single-cell RNA-seq data with more than 1 million entries. Achieved an average accuracy of 90%.
4. Used MLOPs lifecycle to develop deep learning frameworks using graph neural networks, Autoencoders, and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying cancer cells in large single-cell RNA-seq data.
