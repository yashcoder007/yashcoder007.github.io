I was working as a Research Assistant at the lab where I was leading the research group  under the supervision of Dr. Luis Rueda [link](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2OPjLFkAAAAJ&hl=en)

- Developed an unsupervised automatic ML-based customer segmentation technique using dimensionality reduction
and K-means clustering for segmenting customers in terms of income, age and spending.
- Implemented LightGBM for predicting customer categorization to target specific groups of customers more
effectively with customized products, promotions and advertising, reducing churn rate by 10%.
- Implemented SVM and Random Forest with feature selection for predicting the fraud transactions in financial data.Helped in increasing security with the modelâ€™s average accuracy of 93%.
- Used Recurrent Neural Network to predict sales by implementing time series forecasting.
- Developed a novel unsupervised automatic lung tumour detection pipeline by stacking together data mining
techniques like spectral and hierarchical clustering, region adjacency graph, and multilevel thresholding with an
average accuracy of 99.8% and an average sensitivity of 95.15%.
- Reduced the time taken for tumour detection in CT images of size 512 x 512 by applying the concept of superpixels
in the above-mentioned framework. The framework works in O(n), taking only 6s to detect a tumour.
- Implemented SVM, Random Forest and KNN with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for detecting cancer
cells and marker genes responsible for breast cancer single-cell RNA-seq data with more than 1 million entries. Achieved an average accuracy of 90%.
- Used MLOPs lifecycle to develop deep learning frameworks using graph neural networks, Autoencoders, and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying cancer cells in large single-cell RNA-seq data.
