I was working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the lab where I was leading the research group  under the supervision of Dr. Luis Rueda [link](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2OPjLFkAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Finance
1. Developed an unsupervised ML model using K-means clustering and PCA for customer categorization to target
customers with customized promotions and advertising, leading to a 4% increase in the superstore productâ€™s
cross-sell revenue.
2. Developed a time series-based sales forecasting machine learning model for a chain of superstores using Facebook
prophet and ARIMA, with statistical feature engineering resulting in a 10% reduction in inventory costs.
3. Designed a stacked ML model using SVM, Random Forest and LightGBM for fraud credit card transactions
classification with an accuracy of 96%.
4. Designed automated Power BI dashboards for data analysis using SQL views and stored procedures reducing 80%
time spent on manual configuration.

## Computer Vision 
1. Developed a novel unsupervised automatic lung tumour detection pipeline by stacking together data mining techniques like spectral and hierarchical clustering, region adjacency graph, and multilevel thresholding with an average accuracy of 99.8% and an average sensitivity of 95.15%.
2. Reduced the time taken for tumour detection in CT images of size 512 x 512 by applying the concept of superpixels in the above-mentioned framework. The framework works in O(n), taking only 6s to detect a tumour.
3. Implemented SVM, Random Forest and KNN with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for detecting cancer
cells and marker genes responsible for breast cancer single-cell RNA-seq data with more than 1 million entries. Achieved an average accuracy of 90%.
4. Used MLOPs lifecycle to develop deep learning frameworks using graph neural networks, Autoencoders, and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying cancer cells in large single-cell RNA-seq data.
